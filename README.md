# Tips
Personal tips and cheatsheet for different languages and commands.
Among others: `git`, `C`, `gdb`, `awk`...

*Notations and conventions.* You will find stuff inside angle brackets (like this `<.>`): this is something that you can choose.
You will also find other stuff within square brackets (like this `[.]`, and they can be nested): this indicates something that is optional.
